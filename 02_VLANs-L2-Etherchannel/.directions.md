> Part 2 – VLANs, Layer-2 EtherChannel
> 1. In Office A, configure a Layer-2 EtherChannel named PortChannel1 between DSW-A1 and DSW-A2 using a Cisco-proprietary protocol. Both switches should actively try to form an EtherChannel.
> 2. In Office B, configure a Layer-2 EtherChannel named PortChannel1 between DSW-B1 and DSW-B2 using an open standard protocol. Both switches should actively try to form an EtherChannel.
> 3. Configure all links between Access and Distribution switches, including the EtherChannels, as trunk links.
> a. Explicitly disable DTP on all ports.
> b. Set each trunk’s native VLAN to VLAN 1000 (unused).
> c. In Office A, allow VLANs 10, 20, 40, and 99 on all trunks.
> d. In Office B, allow VLANs 10, 20, 30, and 99 on all trunks.
> 4. Configure one of each office’s Distribution switches as a VTPv2 server. Use domain name JeremysITLab.
> a. Verify that other switches join the domain.
> b. Configure all Access switches as VTP clients.
> 5. In Office A, create and name the following VLANs on one of the Distribution switches. Ensure that VTP propagates the changes.
> a. VLAN 10: PCs
> b. VLAN 20: Phones
> c. VLAN 40: Wi-Fi
> d. VLAN 99: Management
> 6. In Office B, create and name the following VLANs on one of the Distribution switches. Ensure that VTP propagates the changes.
> a. VLAN 10: PCs
> b. VLAN 20: Phones
> c. VLAN 30: Servers
> d. VLAN 99: Management
> 7. Configure each Access switch’s access port. 
> a. LWAPs will not use FlexConnect
> b. PCs in VLAN 10, Phones in VLAN 20
> c. SRV1 in VLAN 30
> d. Manually configure access mode and explicitly disable DTP
> 8. Configure ASW-A1’s connection to WLC1:
> a. It must support the Wi-Fi and Management VLANs.
> b. The Management VLAN should be untagged.
> c. Disable DTP.
> 9. Administratively disable all unused ports on Access and Distribution switches.
